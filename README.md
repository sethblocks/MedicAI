# MedicAI
A little python script I made that runs AutoGPT to attempt to diagnose medical conditions

# ⚠Results given by the AI should not be used as a final diagnosis! Consult with your doctor if you suspect you have a medical condition⚠

It's simple to use:

1. download python script and move it to the auto-gpt folder
2. create a file: "symptoms.txt" and write your symptoms
3. run the medicAI.py script and open the outputted text file
